# My Data Science Assignment for Zeotap! 👋

Hi there! This is a data science project as part of zeotap ds intern assignment where I analyze customer behavior and find interesting patterns. Let me walk you through what I've done!

## 📊 What's Inside?

I've split my work into three main parts:

1. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** 
   - `belo_abhigyan_EDA.ipynb` & `belo_abhigyan_EDA.pdf`
   - This is where I first look at my data and try to understand what's going on
   - I check things like missing values and create some neat visualizations

2. **Lookalike Analysis** 
   - `belo_abhigyan_Lookalike.ipynb` & `belo_abhigyan_Lookalike.csv`
   - Here I find similar customers using fancy math (cosine similarity)
   - Perfect for finding customer twins! 👥

3. **Clustering Analysis**
   - `belo_abhigyan_Clustering.ipynb` & `belo_abhigyan_Clustering.pdf`
   - I group similar customers together
   - Used K-means clustering and made some cool visualizations 🎨

## 🛠️ Tools I Used

- Python (my trusty programming language)
- Pandas (for data wrangling)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for making things look pretty)
- Scikit-learn (for the smart stuff like clustering)

## 📝 What I Found

- Cleaned and organized messy data
- Found patterns in customer behavior
- Created groups of similar customers
- Made pretty graphs to show what I learned!

## 🚀 How to Run My Code

1. Make sure you have Python installed
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
